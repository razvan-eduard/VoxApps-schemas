# VoxApps schemas

**Fork this to own the schemas your apps use.**

These are the declarations the VoxApps family reads at runtime: which engines exist, which search
providers answer which category, which media backends can play a video, which services an app
integrates with. Every app ships with its own copy and can be pointed at a repository serving
different ones — this repository, or yours.

Forking the apps to change a provider means maintaining a fork of an Android project. Forking this
means editing JSON.

Nothing here is code. Nothing here can redirect a native library or make an app run something it did
not ship with; these files name services and say how to reach them.

## Using your own

1. **Fork this repository** and edit whatever you want to change.
2. In Vox Commander, open **Settings → General → Schema updates** and set the repository URL to your
   fork: `https://github.com/<you>/<repo>`.
3. Leave *Check for updates at startup* on, or press the refresh button beside the URL.

GitHub disables Actions in a new fork until you turn them on. Doing so is worthwhile: it is what
runs the validator on your edits before your phone does.

The app compares what you serve with what it already has, by content — an unchanged file costs
nothing. A file that differs and still parses is adopted and kept until you change it again.

**The way back is always there.** *Settings → Advanced → System maintenance → Reset schemas to the
shipped ones* deletes everything downloaded from a repository, and the copies that came with the app
apply again. Those are the ones the app was built and tested against, so a broken edit here can
never leave an install stranded.

## Layout

    remote-schemas/
      commander/   read by Vox Commander
      expenses/    read by Vox Expenses
      shared/      read by more than one app

The folder is the list. An app copies its own folder plus `shared/`, and fetches each file from
`<your repo>/main/remote-schemas/<folder>/<file>`. Adding a file ships it; no name is written down
anywhere else.

## The vocabulary

Every service, wherever it is declared, describes itself the same way:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `endpoint` | where the service lives |
| `probe_url` | a cheap URL proving it answers and accepts the credential, **relative to `endpoint`** |
| `auth.style` | `bearer` · `query` · `oauth2` · `none` |
| `auth.param` | the query parameter carrying the key, when `style: query` |
| `auth.flow` | `pkce` · `authorization_code`, for OAuth services |
| `requires_api_key` | the service needs a credential |
| `api_key_url` | where a user obtains one |

`probe_url` resolves like an ordinary relative URL: `models` hangs off the endpoint, `/v1/models`
starts at the host root, `?q=London` adds arguments to the endpoint itself. It is **always a path** —
an absolute URL is refused, because the probe carries that service's credential and a path can only
ever reach the host the endpoint already names.

`{key}` anywhere in a URL is replaced by the credential, for a service that takes its key in the
path. Its presence also means "this needs a credential", so nothing is asked without one.

## Before you push

    python3 scripts/validate_schemas.py remote-schemas

The same check runs here on every push. It is worth caring about: an edit in this repository reaches
every install that follows it on their next check, with no compiler and no test suite in between —
unlike a change to the apps, where the same rules are asserted before a build exists. It catches
non-https endpoints, a `probe_url` that would leave its own host, auth styles the apps do not
implement, an OAuth service that never says which flow it speaks, duplicate provider names, a
`defaultProvider` that is not in its category, a borrowed credential naming an engine nothing
declares, and a built-in media backend pretending to have an endpoint.

`schema_version` in these files is documentation for whoever edits them. The apps no longer read it:
what is in force is what you served, until someone resets it.

## Your fork is yours

You will see a `mirror.yml` workflow in your fork. It cannot run there: GitHub does not run scheduled
workflows in forks, Actions are off in a new fork until you enable them, and the job is guarded to
this repository anyway. It keeps *this* copy in step with the app repository, and nothing in it
reaches into yours.

Taking a later version is a decision you make, and you can see exactly what it would be first:

    https://github.com/<you>/<your-fork>/compare/main...razvan-eduard:VoxApps-schemas:main

or locally, once:

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/razvan-eduard/VoxApps-schemas.git
    git fetch upstream
    git diff upstream/main -- remote-schemas

Then **Sync fork** on GitHub — or `git merge upstream/main` — which surfaces the conflicts where you
and I changed the same file rather than silently picking one.

To stop following your fork altogether, you do not need this repository at all: *Settings → Advanced
→ System maintenance → Reset schemas to the shipped ones* puts the app back on the copies it was
built with.
