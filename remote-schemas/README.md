# Shipped schemas

Every JSON here is copied into an app's assets at build time **and** served from this repository at
runtime, so the same file is both what an app ships with and what it can be corrected by.

    commander/   read by vox-commander
    expenses/    read by vox-expenses
    shared/      read by more than one app

The folder is the list: an app copies `<its own>/*.json` and `shared/*.json`, and nothing names
individual files. Dropping a file into a folder ships it; moving it between folders changes which
apps read it.

An app fetches each file from `<repo>/main/remote-schemas/<folder>/<file>` and compares it by hash
with the copy in force. A copy that differs and still parses is written to the app's `filesDir` and
becomes the source of truth until the user resets it — see `RemoteSchema` in `:core:services`.

**Editing a file here is not enough.** These are adopted unattended at launch and they say where
requests go, so an app refuses a changed schema from this repository unless its hash appears in
`manifest.json` and that manifest is signed. Signing happens on a developer machine — `./scripts/vox schemas sign` — because the key is
deliberately kept out of GitHub, where the release keystore already lives. `verify-schemas.yml`
checks the result on every push touching this folder, and fails if the manifest and the schemas
disagree. An unsigned change is not dangerous — it simply never
reaches anyone.

The manifest also carries a `serial`, and an app refuses one no newer than the last it accepted. A
valid signature does not make a manifest *current*: without that counter, anyone able to serve these
files could replay an old, genuinely signed manifest and walk every install back to an earlier
schema — one naming an endpoint since abandoned, say — with every signature checking out.
